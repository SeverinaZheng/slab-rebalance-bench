# Environment Preparation for Micro-benchmarking
# Target: CloudLab c6320 nodes with Intel Xeon E5-2683 v3 CPUs @ 2.00 GHz
# 
# For accurate micro-benchmarks we need to:
# 1. Disable turbo boost - ensures consistent CPU frequency 
# 2. Enable perf events - allows hardware performance counter access
